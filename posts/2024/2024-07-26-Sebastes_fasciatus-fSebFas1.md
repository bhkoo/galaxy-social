We have finished the curation of Sebastes fasciatus (Acadian redfish), fSebFas1. The files have been uploaded to [GenomeArk](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=species/Sebastes_fasciatus/fSebFas1/assembly_curated/). Curation was done by Kirsty McCaffrey, with QCing by Jo Collins.

Karyotyping indicated 24 chromosome pairs. No sex chromosomes where identified. 99.25% of sequence was assigned to chromosomes in this primary assembly.

Note: For chromosome 7 between 0-788Kb and for chromosome 19 between 0-1.6Mb, the curation team was unsure of the ordering of the fragments in these regions.
