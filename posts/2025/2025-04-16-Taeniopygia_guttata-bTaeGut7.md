![Taeniopygia guttata: The zebra finch, a widely studied Australian songbird known for its vocal learning and significance as a model organism, now has its first fully-phased, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) diploid genome.](https://genomeark.s3.amazonaws.com/species/Taeniopygia_guttata/bTaeGut7/img/bTaeGut7_1.jpg)

The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), native to Australia, is one of the most studied birds in science, for its vocal learning abilities and as a representative songbird.


Fifteen years after the initial draft was published, the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) presents the first fully-phased diploid telomere-to-telomere (T2T) reference genome for the zebra finch, bTaeGut7, which is also the first T2T genome for a songbird. 


Compared to the previous high-quality reference bTaeGut1.4, this new reference closes nearly all gaps in euchromatic and heterochromatic regions, including all microchromosomes and the sex chromosomes.


This genome was sequenced using a combination of PacBio HiFi long reads, Oxford Nanopore Technology ultra-long reads, Arima Genomics Hi-C read for chromosome scaffolding, and Illumina parental short reads for haplotype phasing.
Assembly was done using Verkko followed by manual graph curation.


The assembly is available on NCBI's GenBank: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_048771995.1/
Additional annotations and analyses of this genome are ongoing, with a manuscript in preparation. For any inquiries: vgl (at) rockefeller (dot) edu
